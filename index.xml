      <description>The application of machine learning methods has become present in everyday life. From recommendations of which movies to watch, to which products to buy and recognizing your friends on social media, machine learning algorithms that learn from input/output pairs are called supervised learning algorithms because a “teacher” provides supervision to the algorithms in the form of the desired outputs for each example that they learn from. As creating a dataset of inputs and outputs is often a manual process, supervised learning algorithms are well understood and their performance is easy to measure.</description>

      <description>Lending companies work by analyzing the financial history of their loan applicants and choosing whether or not the applicant is too risky to be given a loan. If the applicant is not, the company determines the terms of the loan. To acquire these applicants, companies can organically receive them through their websites/apps, often with the help of advertisement campaigns. Other times, lending companies partner with peer-to-peer(P2P) lending marketplaces, to acquire leads of possible applicants.</description>

The objective is to show customers content that they would like best based on their historical activity.
We will discuss two types of recommender systems: Demographic Filtering- They offer generalized recommendations to every user, based on movie popularity and/or genre.</description>
